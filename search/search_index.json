After world war 2, the usage of plastic pollution increased rapidly because it provided military success and convenience. Ever since then, the consumption of plastic has never ceased and it\u2019s mostly affecting the ocean. Plastic pollution is the disposal of man-made plastic without being properly managed in the Earth environment that affects all wildlife and humans. Over the past few years, the annual production of plastic has reached 381 million tonnes and the total production cumulatively has hit 7.8 billion tonnes which are more than a tonne of plastic per person. In 1950, only 2 million tonnes of plastic were produced. As the use of plastic increases annually, we will have to face the consequences in our daily lives. One of the most serious issues of plastic pollution is in electronic packaging. Nowadays, plastic is used everywhere in the technology industry. The usage of plastic must be reduced and the management of plastic has to be modified by recycling, avoiding single-use plastics, and replacing plastic packaging.","title":"About me"},{"location":"cau/","text":"Introduction First of all, the main factor that causes the overuse of plastic is due to how convenient it is. Its convenience is also the key reason leading toward the destruction of the ocean. The durability, efficiency, and moldability of plastic make it so popular to use. Plastics safely protect vulnerable objects like all the electronic devices we use today such as iPhones, iMacs, air pods, and pretty much any electronics you purchase from time to time. Plastic is safe, doesn\u2019t break easily, hygienic, free from contamination, light, takes very little space, preserves products for longer, and is the best packaging material we currently have in terms of economics. Even though plastic is one of the most suitable packaging materials, the extensive use of plastic is severely destroying our environment because it takes hundreds of years for plastic to decompose. Also, these plastics we litter enter the ocean in many different ways. Our natural weathers like rain, wind, and storms can all easily sweep and carry plastic debris back into the ocean. Electronic waste(E-waste) is the fastest growing waste on the planet which is accountable for 20% of all plastic production of the 50 million tonnes of plastic we produce each year. The number is estimated to double by 2050 if our manufacturing of plastic in electronic devices doesn\u2019t change. In 2016, 49 million tonnes of e-waste were disposed of and only 15% are recycled.","title":"Causes of Plastic Pollution"},{"location":"cau/#introduction","text":"First of all, the main factor that causes the overuse of plastic is due to how convenient it is.
